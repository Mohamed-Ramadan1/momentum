am working on habits / tasks management system with advanced feature and i have an idea to 
be added in this application the mocks interviews the user will chose a topic as example the system 
design the system will use ai model like grock and gpt or clude to pick a question real world one 
then the user will have time matching as real interview enviroment with some hints allowed the user will 
have white interface to write the answer and prevent the copy and pasting and then the user will answer as it 
requried the question after the ending of the time or the user submit his answer he will receive very detailed
 review on his answer what is missing what is correct and what need to be focused on and also this gon be vi ai 
 model to have interactive detailed experince and recommand topics and stuff to focus on and be ready for the next time the
user will get fair grade out of 10 based on the answer and based of using hints
